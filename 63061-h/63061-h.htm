<p class="noindent">THE HAKLUYT SOCIETY, which is established for the purpose
of printing rare or unpublished Voyages and Travels, aims at opening
by this means an easier access to the sources of a branch of knowledge,
which yields to none in importance, and is superior to most in
agreeable variety. The narratives of travellers and navigators make us<span class="pagenum"><a id="frontmatterPage__2"></a>[2]</span>
acquainted with the earth, its inhabitants and productions; they exhibit
the growth of intercourse among mankind, with its effects on civilization,
and, while instructing, they at the same time awaken attention, by
recounting the toils and adventures of those who first explored unknown
and distant regions.</p>

<p>The advantage of an Association of this kind, consists not merely in its
system of literary co-operation, but also in its economy. The acquirements,
taste, and discrimination of a number of individuals, who feel an
interest in the same pursuit, are thus brought to act in voluntary combination,
and the ordinary charges of publication are also avoided, so that
the volumes produced, are distributed among the Members (who can alone
obtain them) at little more than the cost of printing and paper. The
Society expends nearly the whole of its funds in printing works for the
Members; and since the cost of each copy varies inversely as the whole
number of copies printed, it is obvious that the Members are gainers
individually by the prosperity of the Society, and the consequent vigour
of its operations.</p>

<p>The Members are requested to bear in mind that the power of the
Council to make advantageous arrangements, will depend, in a great
measure, on the prompt payment of the subscriptions, which are payable
in advance on the 1st January, and are received by</p>

<p><i>The Secretary, <span class="smcap">William Desborough Cooley</span>, 33, King-street, Bloomsbury;
or at the <span class="smcap">London Library</span>, 12, St. James’s-square; and by
<span class="smcap">T. Rodd</span>, 9, Great Newport-street, Leicester-square, who is the Society’s
Agent for the delivery of its volumes.</i></p>

<h3 class="gothic">Laws of the Hakluyt Society.</h3>

<p>I. The object of this Society shall be to print, for distribution among its
members, rare and valuable Voyages, Travels, Naval Expeditions, and other geographical
records, from an early period to the beginning of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>II. The Annual Subscription shall be One Guinea, payable in advance on
the 1st January; but Subscribers shall be at liberty to compound at any time
for future years by the payment of ten guineas, and they shall incur no further
liability.</p>

<p>III. Each member of the Society, having paid his subscription, shall be
entitled to a copy of every work produced by the Society, and to vote at the
general meetings within the period subscribed for; and if he do not signify,
before the close of a year, his wish to resign, he shall be considered as a member
for the succeeding year.</p>

<p>IV. The management of the Society’s affairs shall be vested in a Council
consisting of twenty-one members, namely, a President, two Vice-Presidents, a
Secretary, and seventeen ordinary members, to be elected annually; but vacancies
occurring between the general meetings shall be filled up by the Council.</p>

<p>V. A General Meeting of the Subscribers shall be held annually, on the
first Thursday in March, when two gentlemen shall be appointed to audit the
Society’s accounts. The Secretary’s Report on the condition and proceedings
of the Society shall be then read, and, along with the Auditor’s Report, be submitted
for approval; and finally, the Meeting shall proceed to elect the Council
for the ensuing year.</p>

<p>VI. At each Annual Election six of the old Council shall retire; and a
list of the proposed new Council shall be printed for the subscribers previous to
the general meeting.</p>

<p>VII. The Council shall meet ordinarily on the 3rd Tuesday in every
month, excepting August, September and October, for the despatch of business,
three forming a quorum, and the Chairman having a casting vote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="frontmatterPage__6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>VIII. Gentlemen preparing and editing works for the Society shall receive
twenty-five copies of such works respectively.</p>

<p>IX. The number of copies printed of the Society’s productions shall not
exceed the estimated number of Subscribers; so that after the second year, when
the Society may be supposed to have reached its full growth, there shall be no
extra copies.</p>

<p>X. The Society shall appoint Local Secretaries throughout the kingdom,
empowered to enrol members, transmit subscriptions, and otherwise forward the
Society’s interests; and it shall make such arrangements with its correspondents
in the chief provincial towns as will insure to Subscribers residing in the country
the regular delivery of their volumes at moderate charges.</p>

<h3 class="gothic">Rules for the Delivery of the Society’s Volumes.</h3>

<p>I. The Society’s productions will be delivered without any charge, within
three miles of the General Post Office.</p>

<p>II. They will be forwarded to any place beyond that limit, the Society
paying the cost of booking, but not of carriage; nor will it be answerable in this
case for any loss or damage.</p>

<p>III. They will be delivered by the Society’s agent, T. Rodd, Great
Newport-street, to persons having the written authority of subscribers to receive
them.</p>

<p>IV. They will be sent to the Society’s correspondents or agents in the
principal towns throughout the kingdom; and care shall be taken that the
charge for carriage be as moderate as possible.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The name of <span class="smcap">Sir Francis Drake</span> is one of the
brightest ornaments of <span class="smcap">Hakluyt</span>’s collection; and a
Society, which undertakes to continue and complete
the labours of the latter, cannot certainly be better
employed than in publishing documents illustrating
the life and achievements of that distinguished
seaman.</p>

<p>In conformity with this view, the two original
pieces which follow have been selected for publication;
both brief but full of life, and the first of
them, in particular, very racy and characteristic.</p>

<p>The value of Maynarde’s paper (additional MSS.,
No. 5209, in the library of the British Museum),
lies in the writer’s intimacy with Sir Francis Drake,
whom he accompanied in the unfortunate expedition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
which is the subject of the following narrative, and
in the shrewdness of his remarks, clothed occasionally
in the quaintest language. It cannot be denied that
it tends to dispel much of the romance which has
hitherto coloured so brilliantly the history of the
naval hero. But truth is thereby a gainer. Romance
elevates the hero at the expense of human nature,
and sacrifices the many for the glory of one. It
may not be without advantage to learn, from the
example of one so justly celebrated as Drake, what
sordid motives may be cloaked under the pretence
of national glory, and how mistrustfully we ought
to listen to the professedly generous instigators of
war and rapine.</p>

<p>The Spanish paper, Relacion de lo Sucedido, etc.,
(additional MSS. No. 13,964, British Museum), which
has the form of an official report, or dispatch, is
extremely interesting, inasmuch as it allows us to
see, in immediate juxtaposition and direct contrast,
the accounts of the affair at Puerto Rico, as given
by the two belligerent parties.</p>

<p>These papers are here reproduced from the originals
without change or emendation; so that their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
defects, whether attributable to negligence or ignorance,
may be taken into consideration in estimating
their intrinsic worth.</p>

<p>The superficial inaccuracies of Maynarde’s paper
are not a few; his constant misspelling of proper
names, as Corasaw for Curaçoa, St. Tomarta for Sta.
Martha, would seem to prove him illiterate. It is
still more important, that, through oversight and
omission, he states the number of the forces, who
marched from Nombre de Dios to attack Panama,
to be fifty, instead of seven hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>It is amusing to observe the variance between the
Spanish and English accounts of the same action,
both written in good faith. The Spaniards had but
seventy guns, and yet the English reckoned 5160
pieces of artillery playing on them. This tremendous
fire would appear from the English account to have
done no great harm, while the Spaniards allege
that they killed four hundred of the enemy, besides
wounding many more.</p>

<p>But this is not the place for a critical examination
of the following pages. The conflicting statements
and opinions respecting the closing scene of Drake’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
eventful life, are amply detailed in Mr. Barrow’s
justly popular volume. Here it will be sufficient
to observe that Maynarde’s keen and natural comments
on his commanders, proceed from one who,
in regard to Drake, certainly writes in a friendly
spirit, and from whom the truth was wrung by
the circumstances of his situation.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It appears by the attempts and knowen purposes of the
Spaniarde, as by his greedy desire to bee our neighboure in
Bretaine, his fortifienge upon the river of Brest, to gaine so
near us a quiet and safe rode for his fleet, his carelessness in
losinge the strongehouldes and townes which he possessed in
the Lowe Countries, not followinge those warres in that
heate which he wonted, the rebellious rysinge of the Earle
of Tyrone (wrought or drawen thereto undoubtedly by his
wicked practises), that hee leaveth no means unattempted
which he judged might bee a furtherance to turne our tranquillitie
into accursed thraldom; so robbinge us of that
quiet peace which wee, from the hands of Her Majestie
(next under God), aboundently enjoy. This his bloodthirstie
desire foreseene by the wisdome of our queene and
counsayle, they helde no better meanes to curbe his unjust
pretenses, than by sendinge forces to invade him in that
kingdome from whence hee hath feathers to flye to the toppe
of his high desires; they knowing that if for two or three
yeeres a blowe were given him there, that might hinder the
coming into Spaine of his treasure; his povertie, by reason
of his daily huge payments, would be so great, and his men
of warre, most of them mercenaries, that assuredly would
fall from him, so woulde he have more neede of meanes to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
keepe his owne territories, than he nowe hath of superfluitie
to thruste into others rights.</p>

<p>This invasion was spoken of in June 1594, a longe time
before it was put in execution; and it beinge partly resolved
on, Sir Francis Drake was named generall in November
folowinge:—a man of greate spirit and fitt to undertake
matters: in my poore opinion, better able to conduct forces
and discreetly to governe in conductinge them to places
where service was to be done, than to comande in the execution
thereof. But, assuredly, his very name was a great
terror to the enemie in all those partes, havinge heretofore
done many thinges in those countries to his honorable
fame and profitt. But entringe into them as the childe of
fortune, it may be his selfe-willed and peremptorie comand
was doubted, and that caused Her Majestie, as should seeme,
to joyne Sir John Hawkins in equall commission:—a man
oulde and warie, entering into matters with so laden a foote,
that the other’s meat woulde be eaten before his spit could
come to the fire: men of so different natures and dispositions,
that what the one desireth the other would commonly
oppose against; and though their warie cariages sequestred
it from meaner wittes, yet was it apparently seen to better
judgements before our going from Plymouth, that whom the
one loved, the other smaly esteemed. Agreeing best, for
what I could conjecture, in giving out a glorious title to
their intended jorneye, and in not so well victualinge the
navie as, I deeme, was Her Majestie’s pleasure it shoulde
bee, both of them served them to goode purpose, for, from
this havinge the distributinge of so great sommes, their
miserable providinge for us would free them from incurringe
any greate losse, whatsoever befel of the jorney. And the
former drewe unto them so greate repaire of voluntaries<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
that they had choice to discharge suche fewe as they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
pressed, and to enforce the staye of others who gladly would
be partakers of their voyage. But notwithstandinge matters
were very forward, and that they had drawen together three
thousand men, and had ready furnished twenty-seven shippes,
whereof six were Her Majestie’s, yet many times was it very
doubtfull whether the jorney should proceed; and had not
the newes of a gallion of the King of Spaine, which was
driven into St. John de Porterico with two millions and a
halfe of tresure, come unto them by the reporte of certaine
prisoners, whereof they advertised Her Majestie, it is very
likely it had been broken; but Her Majestie, persuaded by
them of the easie takinge therof, comanded them to haste
their departure.</p>

<p>So on Thursday, being the 28th of August, in the year
1595, havinge stayed two moneth in Plimouth, we went
thence twenty-seven sail, and were two thousand five hundred
men of all sortes. This fleet was devided into two
squadrons; not that it was so appointed by Her Majestie, for
from her was granted as powerfull authoritie unto eyther of
them over the whole as any parte, but Sir Francis victualinge
the one halfe and Sir John the other, it made them, as
men afectinge what they had done, to chalenge a greater
prerogative over them than the whole; wherin they wronged
themselves and the action, for wee had not runne sixty or
seventy leagues in our course, before a flagge of councell
was put out in the Garlande, unto which all commanders
with the chiefe masters and gentlemen repayred. Sir
Francis complayned that he had a three hundred men more
in his squadron then were in the other, and that he was
much pestered in his owne shipp, wherof he would gladly be
eased. Sir John gave no other hearinge to this motion, but
seemed to dislike that he should bring more than was concluded
betwixt them, and this drewe them to some cholericke
speeches. But Sir John would not receave any unles
he were entreated: to this Sir Francis’ stout hearte could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
never be driven. This was on the second of September, and
after they were somwhat qualified, they acquainted us that
Sir Thomas Baskerville, our coronell generall, was of theyr
counsayle by vertue of the broade seale, and that they would
take unto them Sir Nicholas Clifforde and the other captains
appointed by Her Majestie, who were, eleven for the
land, four for the shippes in which they themselves went not.
They gave us instructions for directinge our course, if, by
foule weather or mischange, any should be severed, and
orders what alowances we should put our men into for preservation
of victualls, with other necessary instructions. In
the end, Sir John revealed the places whither wee were
bound, in hearinge of the basest mariner; observinge therin
no warlike or provident advice, nor was it ever amended to
the time of theyr deaths, but so he named St. John de
Porterico, where the treasure before spoken of was to be
taken, even withoute blowes, from whence we should go direct
to Nombre de Dios, and so over land to Panama. What other
things should fall out by the way, he esteemed them not
worth the naminge, this being sufficient to make a far
greater armie rich to theyr content.</p>

<p>Some seven or eight days after this, we were called aborde
the Defiance, where, Sir Francis Drake propoundinge unto us
whether we should give upon the Canaries or Maderas (for he
was resolved to put for one of them by the way), we seeinge his
bent and the earnestnes of the coronel generall, together with
the apparent likelihood of profit, might soon have bin drawen
therto; but consideringe the weightie matters we had undertaken
and how needfull it was to hasten us thether [we
did not immediately assent]. But General Hawkins utterly
mislikinge this motion, it beinge a matter, as hee saide,
never before thought of, [he declared he] knewe no cause
why the fleete should staye in any place till they came to the
Indies, unles it should be by his takinge in of so greate
numbers to consume his waters and other provision; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
which, if Sir Francis would acknowledge, hee would ridde
him and relieve him the best hee could. Now the fyer
which laye hid in theyr stomacks began to breake forth,
and had not the coronell pacified them, it would have growen
farther; but theyr heat somwhat abated, and they concluded
to dine next day aboarde the Garlande with Sir John, when
it was resolved that we should put for the Grand Canaries,
though, in my conscience, whatsoever his tonge saide, Sir
John’s harte was againste.</p>

<p>These matters were well qualified, and for that place we
shaped our course, in which we met with a small flemminge
bounde for the Streights and a small manne of warre of Waymouth,
who kept us companie to the Canaries. On Wensday,
the twenty-fourth day, we had sight of Lancerotta and Forteventura.
The twenty-fifth at night we descried the Canaries,
it beinge a monthe after our departure from Plymouth. On
Friday, beinge the twenty-sixth, we came to anchor, some
saker shott from a forte which stands to the west norwest of
the harboure. Sir Francis spent much time in seekinge out
the fittest place to land; the enemie therby gaininge time to
drawe theyr forces in rediness to impeach our approach. At
length we puttinge for the shore in our boats and pinnaces,
found a great seege and such power of men to encounter us,
that it was then thought it would hazarde the whole action if
we should give further upon it, wherupon we returned without
recevinge or doinge any harme worthy the writinge; but,
undoubtedly, had we lanced under the forte at our first
cominge to anchor, wee had put fayre to bee possessors of
the towne, for the delayes gave the enemie greate stomackes
and daunted our owne; and it beinge the first service our
new men were brought into, it was to be doubted they
would prove the worse the whole jorney followinge.</p>

<p>We presently wayed hence and came to anchor the twenty-seventh
at the west south west part of this islande, where
wee watered. Here Captaine Grimstone, one of the twelve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
captaines for lande, was slaine by the mountainors, with his
boy and a surgeon. Hence wee departed the twenty-eighth,
houldinge our course south-west three weeks, then we ran
west south west and west and by south till the twenty-seventh
of October, on which day we had sight of Maten, an
island lying south-est from Dominica. Our generalls ment
to water at Guadalupe, for Dominica beinge inhabited by
Indians, our men straglinge soon would have their throates
cutte. Generall Drake lyinge ahead the fleet, ran in by the
mouth of Dominica, Sir John by south. The twenty-ninth
we anchored under Guadalupe; Sir Francis beinge there a
daye before us. On the thirtieth, Josias, captaine of the
Delight, brought newes to the generalls, that the Francis, a
small shippe of companie, was taken by nine frigotts, wherupon
Sir Francis would presently have folowed them either
with the whole fleete or some parte, for that he knew our
intentions were discovered by reason they were so openly
made knowne, as I afore have set downe, by Sir John Hawkins.
Sir John would in no wise agree to eyther of these
motions, and he was assisted in his opinion by Sir Nicholas
Clifforde, all others furtheringe his desires, which might be
a means to staye them for goinge into Porterico before us;
but Sir John prevayled, for that hee was sickly, Sir Francis
beinge loth to breed his further disquiet. The reason of his
stay was, to trimme his shippes, mounte his ordinance, take
in water, set by some new pinnaces, and to make things in
that rediness, that he cared not to meet with the king’s
whole fleete. Heere we stayed doinge these necessaries
three dayes. This is a desarte, and was without inhabitants.</p>

<p>On the fourth of November we departed, and being becalmed
under the lee of the land, Sir Francis caused the Richarde,
one of the victuallers, to be unladen and sunk. The eighth
wee anchored amonge the Virginees, other west ilandes:
heere we drew our companie on shore, that every man might
knowe his colours, and wee founde our companie shorte of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
the one thousand two hundred promised for lande service,
few of the captains having above ninety, most not eighty,
some not fifty; which fell out partly for that the generalls
had selected to them a companie for theyr guarde, of many
of the gallantest men of the army. Sir John his sicknes
incresed. Sir Francis apointed captaines to the merchants’
shippes: this consumed time till the eleventh, when we
passed a sounde, though, by our mariners, never passed by
fleet afore, and we came to anchor before Porterico on the
twelfth, about three of the clocke in the afternoone, at what
time Sir John Hawkins died. I made my men ready presently
to have landed, knowinge that our sodaine resolution
would greatly have danted the enemie, and have held our
[own men] in opinion of assured victory; but I was countermanded
by authoritie, and during the time of our deliberation,
the enemie labored by all meanes to cause us to disankar,
so workinge, that within an houre hee had planted three or
four pieces of artillery upon the shore next unto us, and
playinge upon the Defiance, knowing her to be the Admirall,
whilest our generalls sate at souper with Sir Nicholas Clifford
and diverse other, a shotte came amongst them, wherwith
Sir Nicholas, Brute, Brown, Captain Strafford, who had
Greenstone’s company, and some standers by, were hurte.
Sir Nicholas died that night, so secondinge Sir John Hawkins
in his death as he did in his opinion at Guadalupe.
My brother Browne lived five or six days after, and died
much bewayled. This shotte made our generall to way and
fall further to the westward, where we rode safely. The five
frigotts before spoken of rode within their forts: wee had no
place nowe to lande our men but within them in the face of
the towne, which was dangerous, for that both shippes and
forts could playe on us; it was therefore concluded that boats
should fire them where they rode. Captain Poore and mysealfe
had the comande of this service; for the regiments,
Captain Salisburie comandinge; the grand captain companye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
was sent by the generalls; diverse sea commanders were also
sent; and on the thirteenth at night passinge in harde under
the forte, we set three of them on fire; only one of which, it
was my chance to undertake, was burnt; on the others, the
fire held not by reason that being once out they were not
maintained with newe. The burnte shippe gave a greate
light, the enemie thereby playinge upon us with their ordinance
and small shotte as if it had been fayre daye, and
sinkinge some of our boates: a man could hardly comande
his mariners to row, they foolishly thinkinge every place
more dangerous than where they were, when, indeede, none
was sure. Thus doinge no harme, we returned with two or
three prisoners, when, indeede, in my poore oppinion, it had
binne an easier matter to bringe them out of the harborowe
than fire them as wee did, for our men aboard the shippes
numbred five thousand one hundred and sixty peeces of
artillerie that played on us during this service; and it had
binne less dangerous to have abidden them close in the frigotts
and in the darke than as wee did; but great comanders
many tymes fayle in theyre judgment, beinge crost by a
compartner; but I had cause of more griefe than the Indies
could yielde mee of joye, losinge my Alfierez,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Davis Pursell;
Mr. Vaughan, a brother-in-law of Sir John Hawkins, with
three others; Thomas Powton, with five or six more hurte and
maimed; and was somwhat discomfited, for the generall
feigned heere to set up his rest; but examininge the prisoners,
by whom hee understoode that these frigotts were sent
for his treasure, and that they would have fallen amonge us
at Guadalupe had they not taken the Francis, his minde
altered: callinge to counsaile, he comanded us to give our
opinions what we thought of the strength of the place. Most
thought it would hazard the whole action. But one Rush, a
captaine, more to mee aleadged that without better puttinge
for it, [than by] the bare lookinge upon the outside of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
forts, we could hardly give such judgment; and I set it playnely
under my hande, that if we resolutely attempted it, all was
ours; and that I persuaded mysealfe no towne in the Indies
could yielde us more honnor or profitte. The generall presently
saide: “I will bring thee to twenty places farre more
wealthye and easier to be gotten.” Such-like speeches I
thinke had bewitched the coronell for he most desired him
to hasten him hence.</p>

<p>The enemie, the day after we had fired the frigotts, suncke
together four to save us labour, but chiefly to strengthen
their fortes: two other greate shippes they suncke and fired
in the mouth of the harborowe to give them light to playe on
us from theyr fortes as we entred the first night. And hence
we went the fifteenth. Heere I left all hope of good successe.</p>

<p>On the nineteenth we came to anchor in a fayre baye (the
baye of Sta. Jermana), at the westermost part of the ilande,
where wee stayed till the twenty-fourth, settinge up more newe
pinnaces and unlodinge the other newe victualler, the generall
takinge the most parte into his owne shippe as he did of the
former. Captaine Yorke, in the Hope, was made vice-admirall.
This is a very pleasant and fertile ilande, having upon it goode
store of cattell, fruites, and fish, with all thinges necessary to
man’s sustenance; and were it well manured, no place could
yielde it in greater abundance or better. Departing hence,
we had our course for Corasaw.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The seconde daye after our
puttinge of, the Exchange, a small shippe, spronge her mast,
and was sunke; the men and parte of the victualls were
saved by other shippes. Twenty-ninth.—Upon Corasaw
there is great store of cattell and goates, and we fell with it
upon Saturday the twenty-ninth; but our generall, deceaved
by the currante and westerly course, made it for Arabir,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> an
iland lyinge ten or twelve leagues to the westwarde, and so
made no staye; when, next morninge descryenge whether
hee founde his error, wee bore with Cape De la Vela, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
from thence our coronell, with all the companies in the
pinnaces and boates were sent to the cittie of Rio de la
Hacha, and with small resistance wee tooke it the first of
December at night. The generall came unto us the next
morning with the fleete. This towne was left bare of goodes:
the inhabitants havinge intelligence of our cominge, had
caried all in the woodes, and hid theyr treasure in casshes;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
but, stayinge heere seventeen days, wee made so goode
search, that little remained unfounde within four leagues of
the towne. We tooke many prisoners, Spaniards and negroes,
some slaves repairinge to us voluntarily. The generall
with two hundred men went in boates to Lancheria, which is
a place where they fish for pearle, standinge ten leagues to
the estwarde of theyr towne, from whence they brought
goode store of pearle, and tooke a carvell, in which was some
monie, wine, and myrr.</p>

<p>During our stay heere, the governor once, diverse others
often, repaired unto us to redeeme theyr towne, Lancheria,
boates and slaves. They did this to gaine time to convey
away the kinge’s treasure and to advertyse theyr neighbour
towne to convey their treasure in more safetye then themselves
had done; for the whole (except the slaves who
voluntarily repayred unto us) was yielded unto them for
twenty-four thousand peasos, five shillings and sixpence a
peece, to bee payde in pearles; bringinge these to theyr
towne at the daye and valuinge in double the price they
were worth. Our generall delivered the hostages and set
their towne (Lancheria) and boates on fire, carryinge their
slaves with us. The wealth we had heere was given to countervayle
the charge of the jorney; but I feare it will not so
prove in the end. Our vice-admirall, Captaine Yorcke, died
heere of sicknes. This is an exceedinge goode countrye,
champion and well inhabited; great store of cattayle, horses,
sheepe, goates, fish, and fowle, wheron wee fedde, but smale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
store of graine or fruite neere the towne, rich only in pearle
and cattell.</p>

<p>The twentieth, being Saturday, we came to St. Tomarta.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
We suncke two catches before we came to Rio de la Hacha,
which we brought out of England. Presently, upon our
coming to anchors, we landed and gave upon the town. We
found small resistance more than a fewe shotte playinge out
of the woodes as we marched towards the towne. Companies
were presently sent abroade to discover and searche
the countrye. The inhabitants had to long forewarninge to
carry theyr goods out of our possibilitie to find them in so
short time; little or nothing of valew was gotten, only the
Leiftenant-governor and some others were taken prisoners;
and firyinge the towne the twenty-first, we departed.</p>

<p>Captain Worrell, our trenchmaster, died at this towne of
sicknes. This was a very prettie towne, and six leagues off
there was a gould mine. If part of our companie had been
sent thither upon our first arrival at Rio de la Hacha,
doubtles we had done much goode, but now they had scrube
it very bare. In this place was great store of fruite and
much fernandobuck;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> for that the winde blewe so extremely,
and the rode wilde, we could not shippe it. Before we departed
hence, it was concluded that we should passe Cartagena
and go directly for Nombre de Dios. We anchored in
the rode on Sunday followinge, beinge the twenty-seventh;
and landinge presently, receavinge some small shotte from
the towne, we founde small resistance more than a little
forte at the east side of theyr towne, in which they had left
one peece of ordinance which brake at the first shotte. They
gave upon us as we gave upon them: certaine prisoners were
taken in the flyinge, who made it knowne, that havinge intelligence,
longe before, of our cominge, theyr treasure was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
conveyed to places of more safetie, eyther to Panama or
secretly hidden; and it might very well bee, for the towne
was left very bare; wherefore it was resolved that we should
hasten with speed for Panama. Nombre de Dios standeth
on the north-side sea, Panama upon the south, distant some
eighteen or nineteen leagues. There were only two wayes
to get thither; one by the river Chagree, which lyeth to the
westward twenty leagues; upon this it is passable within
five leagues of Panama: the other through deserts and over
mountaines voide of inhabitants: this was troublesom and
harde, as well for want of means to carry our provision of
meate and munition as for the ill passage with an armie
through these deserts and unknown places. That by the
river our generall held more dangerous, fayninge there was
no place for our fleet to wade safely. This made our coronell
to yeelde to the waye by the mountaine, though he and
others foresawe the danger before our settinge hence; but he
resolved to make tryall of what coulde be done.</p>

<p>So on Monday the twenty-ninth we began our jorney,
takinge with us the strongest and lustiest of our armie, to the
number of fifty men and seven colours. Before our settinge
hence, we buried Captaine Arnolde Baskerville, our serjant-major
generall, a gallant gentleman. The first daye we
marched three leagues; the next, six leagues, where we came
to a greate house which the enemie had sett on fire, it beinge a
place where the kinge’s mules do use to lodge cominge from
Panama to Nombre de Dios with his treasure: it is the midway
betwixt both places. The house would receave five hundred
horses. We had not marched fully a league on Wednesday
morninge, when we came to a place fortified upon the
toppe of an hill, which the enemie defended. We had noe
other way to passe nor noe means to make our approach but
a very deepe lande, where but one could passe at once, unles
it were by clammeringe upon the bancks and creepinge up
the hill through the brakes, which some of our men did, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
came to the trees which they had plasshed to make theyr
palizadoe, over which they coulde not passe, the many bowes
so hindered them. It was my chance, clammeringe up the
banckes to repaire to three musketters which I had holpen
up, to fall directly betwixt two of theyr places fortified,
cominge unto two paths by which they fetched their water,
and givinge presently upon them, the place being open, my
small number found to goode resistance, and I was driven to
retire with the losse of these fewe. Heere was the only
place to beate them from theyr houlde, wherof I sent the
coronell worde, Captaine Poore and Bartlett and others
repayringe to me. I shewed them the path; we heard the
enemie plasshinge and fellinge of trees farre before us. The
coronell sent for us to come unto him: he debated with us
what he foresaw before our cominge from Nombre de Dios,
and though he thought, in his oppinion, we should feare the
enemie hence, yet, havinge retreits upon retreits, they would
kill our best men without takinge little or any hurte themselves;
and our men began to drop apace; our powder and
match were spoilde by much rain and waters which we had
passed, unles it were such as som of our souldiers had with
more care preserved. The provision for meate at our coming
from Nombre de Dios was seven or eight cakes of bisked or
ruske for a man, which was eyther by wette spoyled, or theyr
greediness had devoured; so there remained to fewe one
daye’s bread; to most none at all. Our hurte men, as
Captaine Nicholas Baskerville and some other of accounte,
we should be driven to leave to the mercie of the enemie,
unles they could houlde companie. Before our cominge to
Panama, had we beaten them from all these houlds, which I
think would have bin to dangerous for us to have attempted,
consideringe the estate we were in, we must have fought
with them at a bridge where they had intrenched themselves
in a far greater number than we were; and it is manifest, if
we had not within three days gotten some releife, we had bin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
overthrowen, though no enemie had fought against us. But
our stomacks callinge these, with other dangers, to his carefull
consideration, he resolved to retire, and so commanded
us to cause the slaine to be throwne out of sight, the hurte
to be sent to the quarter from whence we came that morninge,
and the rest to be drawen away. Heere were slaine
Captaine Marchant, our quarter-master, with some other
officers, gentlemen, and souldiers. Upon our coming to the
quarter, the coronell took view of the hurte, and for such as
could ride he procured all the horses of the armie; for the
other, he entreated the enemie to entreate them kindly, as
they expected the like from us towards theyrs, of which we
had a farre greater number.</p>

<p>On the seconde of January we returned to Nombre de
Dios; our men so wearied with the ilnes of the waye, sur-baited
for want of shoes, and weake with theyr diet, that it
would have bin a poor dayes service that we should have
done upon an enimie had they been there to resist us. I am
persuaded that never armie, great or small, undertooke a
march through to unknown places so weakly provided and
with so small means to help themselves, unles it might be
some few goinge covertly to do som sodaine exploite before
it were thought of by the enemie, and so returne unspied;
for, undoubtedly, two hundred men foreknowinge their intentions
and provided with all things necessarie, are able to
breake or weaken the greatest force that any prince in Christendome
can bringe thither, if he had place to finde more than
we had. This marche had made many swere that he will
never venture to buy gould at such a price againe. I confesse
noble spiritts, desirous to do service to theyr prince and
country, may soon be persuaded to all hardnes and danger;
but havinge once made tryall therof, would be very loth, as I
suppose, to carry any force that way againe; for beholdinge it
in many places, a man would judge it dangerous for one man
to passe alone, almost impossible for horses and an armie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>The daye that our generall had newes of our returne, he
ment to way and fall nearer to the river Chagree with the
fleete, leavinge some few to bringe us if we were enforced to
retire, wherof hee little doubted. But beinge beaten from
the place where it appeered all his hopes rested for gayninge
to himselfe and others this masse of treasure which he so
confidently promised before, it was high time for him to
devise of some other course. Wherfore, on the fourth of
January, he called us to counsayle, and debated with us what
was nowe to be done. All these parties had notice long
before of all our intentions, as it appeered by letters written
from the governor of Lima to the governor of Panama and
Numbre de Dios, givinge them advice to be carefull and to
looke well to themselves, for that Drake and Hawkins were
makinge readie in England to come upon them. Lima is
distant from these places more than three hundred leagues,
all overlayed with snakes. It appeareth that they had good
intelligence. This made them to convey theyr treasure to
places which they resolved to defend with better force than
we were able to attempt. Like as upon the cominge of the
sun, dewes and mistes begin to vanish, so our blinded eyes
began now to open, and wee founde that the glorious
speeches, of an hundred places that they knew in the Indies
to make us rich, was but a baite to drawe Her Majestie to
give them honorable employments and us to adventure our
lives for theyr glory; for now cards and mappes must bee
our cheefest directors, hee beinge in these partes at the furthest
limit of his knowledge. There hee found out a place
called Laguna de Nichoragua, upon which standeth certaine
townes, as Granada, Leon, and others; also the bay of Honduras,
a place knowne to be of small wealth by itsealfe, unles
it be brought thither to be imbarqued for Spaine. He
demanded which of those we would attempt; our coronell
saide, bothe, one after another, and all to little to content us
if wee tooke them. It was then resolved that we should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
first for the river, and as matters fell out, for the other.
Numbre de Dios, together with their negroe towne were
fyred; and we suncke and fyred fourteen small frigotts which
we founde in the rode. We gott here twenty barres of silver,
with som gould and certaine plate; more would have
benne founde, had it bene well sought; but our generall
thought it folly to gather our harvest graine by graine,
beinge so likely at Panama to thrust our handes into the
whole heapes: and after our returne, beinge troubled in
minde, hee seemed little to regard any consayle that should
be given him to that purpose, but to hasten thence as fast as
he might. This is a most wealthy place, being setled upon
a grounde full of camphyre, environed with hilly woodes and
mountaines, the bottom a dampish fen. Hence wee departed
the fifth, and held our course for Nichragua.</p>

<p>On the ninth we founde a very deepe and dangerous baye,
playinge it here up and downe: all men weary of the place.
The tenth we descried a small iland called Escudes, where
we came to anchor: and here we tooke a frygotte which
was an advice of the kinge’s. By this we learned that the
townes standinge upon this lake, were of small wealth and
very dangerous, by reason of many shoals and greate roughes
our mariners should have, it beinge an hundred leagues: yet
if the winde would have permitted, we had assuredly put for
them, and never returned to one halfe againe. Heere we
stayed, at a waste island where there was no reliefe but a few
tortoyses for such as could catch them, twelve days. This
is counted the sickliest place of the Indies; and heere died
many of our men, victualls beginninge to growe scarse with
us. In the end, findinge the winde to continue contrary, he
resolved to departe, and to take the winde as God sent it.</p>

<p>So on the twenty-second we went hence, having there
buried Captaine Plott, Egerton, and divers others. I questioned
with our generall, beinge often private with him whilst
we stayed heere, to see whether hee would reveale unto mee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
any of his purposes; and I demanded of him, why hee so
often conjured me, beinge in England, to stay with him in
these partes as longe as himselfe, and where the place was.
He answered me with griefe, protestinge that hee was as
ignorant of the Indies as mysealfe, and that he never thought
any place could be so changed, as it were from a delitious
and pleasant arbour into a wast and desarte wildernesse;
besides the variableness of the winde and weather, so stormie
and blusterous as hee never sawe it before. But hee most
wondred that since his cominge out of England he never
sawe sayle worth givinge chace unto: yet in the greatness of
his minde, hee would, in the end, conclude with these wordes:
“It matters not, man; God hath many thinges in store for
us; and I knowe many means to do Her Majestie good service
and to make us riche, for we must have gould before
wee see Englande”; when, goode gentleman, (in my conceite)
it fared with him as with some careles livinge man who prodigally
consumes his time, fondly perswadinge himselfe that
the nurse that fedde him in his childhood will likewise
nourish him in his ould age, and, finding the dugge dried and
withered, enforced then to behould his folly, tormented in
mind, dieth with a starved bodie. Hee had, beside his own
adventure, gaged his owne reputation greatly, in promisinge
Her Majestie to do her honorable service, and to returne her
a very profitable adventure; and havinge sufficiently experienced,
for seven or eight years together, how hard it was
to regain favour once ill thought of, the mistresse of his
fortune now leavinge him to yield to a discontented minde.
And since our returne from Panama he never caried mirth
nor joy in his face; yet no man hee loved must conjecture
that hee tooke thought thereof. But heere hee began to
grow sickly. At this iland we suncke a carvell which we
brought out of England, puttinge her men and victualls into
a last taken frigott. From hence a great currante setts
towards the estward; by reason wherof, with the scant of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
winde we had on Wednesday, beinge the twenty-eight, we
came to Portabella, which is within eight or nine leagues of
Numbre de Dios. It was the best harborough we came unto
sence we left Plymouth.</p>

<p>This morninge, about seven of the clocke, Sir Francis died.
The next day Sir Thomas Baskerville caried him a league of,
and buried him in the sea. In this place, the inhabitants of
Numbre de Dios meant to build a towne, it beinge far more
healthye than where they dwell. Heere they began a forte
which alreadie cost the kinge seven thousand purses, and a
fewe houses towards their town, which they called Civitas
Sti. Philippi. Them we fired, rasinge the fortification to the
grounde. Heere we found, as in other places, all abandoned;
theyr ordinance cast into the sea, some of which we founde,
and caried aboard the Garland.</p>

<p>Our generalls beinge dead, most men’s heartes were bent
to hasten for England as soon as they might; but Sir
Thomas Baskervile havinge the comand of the armie by vertue
of Her Majestie’s broad seale, endeavoured to prevent
the disseveringe of the fleet, and to that end, talked with
such as hee hearde intended to quite companie before they
were disembogued, and drew all companies to subscribe to
certaine articles signifyinge our purposes—viz., that puttinge
hence, wee should turne it backe to St. Tomarto<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> if the winde
would suffer us, otherwise to run over for Jamaica, where it was
thought we should bee refreshed with some victualls. Matters
thus concluded, the Delight, the Elizabeth, and our late
taken frigotts were suncke. Many of the negro men and
base prisoners were here put on shore; and heere we wayed
on Sunday the eighth of February. Our victualls began to
shorten apace, yet we had lyen a longe time at very harde
alowance,—four men each morninge one quarte of beere and
cake of biskett for diner, and for supper one quarte of beere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
and two cakes of biskett and two cans of water, with a pinte
of pease or half a pinte of rise or somwhat more of oatemeale.
This was our allowance beinge at Portabella and six weekes
before, but that we had sometime stockfish. From thence
there is a current that sets to the eastward, by the helpe of
which, on the fourteenth, wee had sight of an iland shorte of
Carthagena fifteen or sixteen leagues; further than this wee
could not go to the estward, for that the current had left us.
The fifteenth at night, it beinge faire weather, we lost sight
of our fleete. Heere as I grew discontented, knowinge it
touched my poore regulation so to leave the armie; and I had
many thinges to perswade mee that it was done of purpose
by the captaine and master, therby gaininge an excuse to
departe; I shewed the captaine of the danger he should run
into by leavinge so honorable forces when they had neede of
our companie: and God knoweth that had I had but judgment
which way to have cast for them, I would rather have
lost my life then so forsake the like. He deposed on the
bible, and Christianitie made me believe him. But playinge
it up and downe about twelve of the clocke, and discoveringe
none of them, the wind blew so contrary that the seamen
affirmed by houldinge this course we should be cast backe in
the bay, and they perswaded that our fleete could not attaine
St. Tomarto, but were gone over for Jamaica, whither they
would follow then. I plainly forsaw that if we missed them
there, it was like that we should no more meete till we came
to England, which would have made me to perswade a longer
search upon the maine; but my hope of their beinge there,
together with the weakness of our men and the small meanes
we had to retaine them, fearinge lest my delay might endanger
Her Majesties shippes and the whole companie, I
yielded to theyr perswasions. We were in ten degrees and
a halfe when we put from hence, and we came till the
twenty-second, when we had sight of a very dangerous shoale
which our seamen thought they had passed neare two dayes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
before. If we had fallen with it in the night we had bin all
lost. The shoale is named Secrana.</p>

<p>On Shrove Wensday, being the twenty-fourth, we fell with
Jamaica, and by meanes of a Mulatow and an Indian, we
had, this night, forty bundles of dried beife, which served
our whole companie so many dayes. We came to anchor at
the westermost parte of the iland, in a faire, sandie bay,
where we watered, and stayed, in hope to have some newes of
our fleete, seven dayes. This, our stay, brought no intelligence,
wherfore our seamen thought that our fleet, not able
to recover this place, were fallen eyther with Cape Corantes
or Cape St. Antoine<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; these places we ment to touch in our
course; and hence we went the first of March. On the sixth
we sawe a shippe on the leaward of us, and the next morninge
we made her to be the Pegasine, one of our fleete, who,
as they sayde, lost the admirall neere the time as we did,
beinge by the coronell sent to the Susan Bonaventure,
whom they left in greate distresse, by reason of a lake they
had taken, and I greatly feared, by theyr reporte, they are
perished. There were in her one hundred and thirty or
one hundred and forty persons, many gallant gentlemen and
good men. If they perish, this shippe shall repent it.
Houldinge our course for these places, we descried five
sayles a stern of us. We stayed for them, and soone made
them to be none of our fleete; and we had good reason to
perswade us they were enimies. They had the winde of us,
but we soone regained it upon them, which made them,
upon a peece of ordinance shott of by the greatest shippe,
tacke about; we tackt with them; when the captain of this
shippe faithfully protested unto me not to shoote a peece of
ordinance till we came boord and boorde, and then I promised
him, with our small shot, to win the greatest or lose
our persons. This we might have done without endangeringe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Her Majestie’s shippes; but our enimie, playinge upon us
with theyr ordinance, made our gunners fall to it ere we were
at musket shot, and no nearer could I bringe them, though I
had no hope to take any of them but by boordinge. Heere
we popt away powder and shott to no purpose, for most of
our gunners would hardly have stricken Paule’s steeple had
it stoode there. I am a yonge seaman, yet my small judgment
and knowledge makes me avowe, that never shippe of
Her Majestie’s went so vilely manned out of her kingdom;
not twenty of them worthy to come into her shippes; and I
know not what had possessed the captaine, but his mind was
cleane altered, tellinge me that he had no authoritie to lay
any shippe aboorde, wherby he might endanger this, Her
Majestie’s; and they beinge, as he sayd, the kinge’s men of
warre, they would rather fire with us than be taken. Had I
beene a marchant of her burden (God favoringe me), they
would have bin mine, as many as stoode to the tryall of
theyr fortune; but the paltrie Pegosie we lately met withall
never came neere us by a league, which was some colour to
our men to give them over. So after I had endeavored by
mysealfe, my lewetenant and other gentlemen, by perswasion,
to worke the captaine resolutely to attempt them, and findinge
no disposition in him but to consume powder and shott
to no purpose, but firinge it in the ayer, I yielded to give
them over, perswadinge mysealfe that God had even ordained
that we should not with any nature attempt where
we were resisted with never so weake forces. Thus away we
went, and the winde choppinge us southerly, our seamen
held that our fleete coulde neither ride at Corants nor at
St. Antony, which made me condescend to leave the Indies,
with all her treasure, and to plye the next course to disembogue,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
for little hope was left me that we should do Her
Majestie any service, or good to our selves, when, upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
feigned excuses of endangering her shippes which she sent
forth to fight if occasion were offered; and to perswade mysealfe
that. Her Majestie priseth not her ships deerer than
the lives of so many faithful subjects, who gladly would have
ventured theyr lives, and upon no brain-sick humour, but
from a trew desire to do Her Highness some service for
the charge and adventure she had been at in this glorious
spoken-of jorney. Fortune’s child was dead, thinges would
not fall into our mouthes, nor riches be our portions, howe
dearly soever we adventured for them. Thus avoydinge Silla
(after the proverbe), we felle into Charibdis, and indeede we
were not nowe farre from it.</p>

<p>Our master, a careful ould man, but not experienced upon
these coastes, rather followinge the advice of others than
relienge on his owne judgment, brought us, on the twelfth,
three hours before daye, into a very shallow water, upon a
dangerous bancke, which some held to be the Meltilettes,
others for the Tortugas, eyther like enough to have swallowed
us, had not God blest us with fayre weather. Freinge
ourselves of this danger, upon Monday the fifteenth of
March we entered the gulfe, and by ten of the clocke we
brought the Cape of Florida west of us. On the seventeenth
(the Lord be thanked) we were disembogued. After
this, we ran with most fowle weather and contrary windes
till the first of May, when we had soundinge in ninety
fathoms, beinge in the Channell, and on the third we had
sight of Sylly; the which day, ere night, we came to anchor,
(the Lord be therefore praysed) 1596.</p>

<p>To give mine oppinion of the Indies, I verily think that
filchinge men of warre shall do more goode then such a
fleete, if they have aine forewarninge of theyr cominge. And
unles Her Majestie will undertake so royally as to dispossesse
him of the landes of Porterico, Hispaniola, and
Cuba, her charge will be greater in sendinge thither, then
the profitt such a fleet can returne, for havinge but a fewe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
days warninge, it is easy for them to convey theyr goods
into assured safetie, as experience hath taught us. Theyr
townes they dare not redeeme, beinge enjoyned the contrary
by the kinge’s comandment. These places will be taken
and possessed by two thousand men; and by this Her
Majestie might debarre the kinge of Spain of his whole profitt
of the Indies: and the first gaininge them will return
her a sufficient requittal for her adventure. God grant I
may live to see such an enterprise put in practise; and the
kinge of Spaine will speedily flye to what conditions of
peace Her Majestie will require.</p>

<p>Thus I have truly set down the whole discourse of our
voyage, usinge therin many idle wordes and ill-compared
sentences. It was done on the sea, which I thinke can alter
any disposition. Your loves, I thinke, can pardon these
faltes, and secret them from the vewe of others.</p>

<p>The first of March the fleete fell with the Pinnas,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> on the
land of Cuba, which day they had sight of the Spanish fleete
by eleven of the clocke; where Sir Thomas Baskervile gave
directions for the fleete as thus:—the Garland, being admirall,
with one halfe of the fleete to have the vanguard; the
Hope, beinge vice-admirall, with the other halfe, the rereward.
The fight continued fiercely three hours within muskett
shott. That night they saw the Spanish Vice-admirall,
a ship of seven hundred tonne, burned, with other six lost
and suncke by the next morninge, when they departed. The
Hope received a leake and was forced to go from the fleete
to an iland, called St. Crusado, inhabited by canniballs,
where they had store of hens and Indian wheate for nine
weekes. March eighth, the fleete shott the gulfe and came
for England, leavinge Florida on the starboard side; and
when they came to the Inchanted Islands they were dispersed,
and came home one by one.</p>

<p class="noindent">Aviendo salido de la Avana para Espana el general
Sancho Pardo y Osorio a los 10 de Março deste año, con
la capitana de la flota de tierra firme de su cargo, en conserva
de la armada de don Franᵒ. Coloma, y aviendose
allado<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> en la tormenta que corrio desembocada de la canal a
los 15 del dho mes en altura de 28 grados y medio, sin arbol
mayor, rompido el timon, y la nao haciendo mucha agua,
apartada de las demas, imposibilitada de seguir su viage,
para salvar las vidas de 300 personas que en ella venian y
dos millones de oro y plata de su Magestad y particulares,
con acuerdo y parecer del vehedor Martin Vomero de
Caamaño y de los pilotos y demas personas platicas que alli
se allaron, aribo a Puerto rico a donde bien milagrosamente
llego a los 9 de April, y alli desembarco y puso la Plata en
la fortaleça de la ciudad. Luego el dho general despacho a
su Magestad primero y secundo aviso haciendoles saver su
ariba, para que mandase lo que hubiese de haçer, y parece
que la divina [providencia] permitio por secretos suyos que
la orden, pudiendo ser antes, llegare a tiempo que no solo
aseguro la Plata sino esta tierra y seria posible todas las
Yndias, por lo que adelante se vera, aquien se pueden dar
muchas gratias.</p>

<p>Pocos dias despues de aver despachado los dhos avisos, los
tuvo de su Magestad el governador desta ysla Pedro Suares<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Coronel en que le aviso en que en Yngalaterra se aprestava una
gruesa armada para venir aganar esta ysla en tiempo de embierno,
por pareçer que entonçes estaria menos apercevida.
Entendidos por el general y el dho veedor los dhos avisos se
juntaron con el governador y con Franᵒ. Cid, capitan de la
ynfanteria deste presidio, y tratado y conferido las preventiones
que se debian haçer para seguridad de la tierra y Plata
de su Magestad para que en caso que el enemigo viniese no
se apoderase de todo ello, fueron todos juntos a reconecer
los sitios y baraderos por donde el enemigo podia acometer y
echar gente en tierra, y que en las partes que al general le
parecio, mando plantar parte de la artilleria de su capitana y
atravesar la nao en la canal del puerto, para que quando
viniese el enemigo, se echase a fondo y sele çegase la entrada,
pareciendo que por alli avia de acometer y lo demas riesgo,
y contener la gente en buena guarida; se estubo en espera de
la orden de su Magestad para hacer su viage.</p>

<p>A los 13th de Nobiembre deste año llego a este puerto
Don Pedro Tello de Guzman, con las cincas fragatas de su
Magestad para que el general Sancho Pardo embarcase en
ella la plata de su Magestad y se fuese la buelta de españa,
haciendo officio de su Almirante el dho Pedro Tello, el qual
despues de aver entregado sus despachos, le dijo al dho
general como viniendo en seguimiento de su viage, avian
encontrado dos navios yngleses en la ysla de Guadalupe, que
se avian apartado de la armada ynglesa y que su almirante
Gonçalo Mendez de Canço avia rendido y echado a fondo el
uno, despues de aver le sacado os yngleses prisiones y que
yendo el dho Don Pedro en seguimiento del otro navio descubrio
nueve velas de la armada del enemigo, y desque las
vio viro la otra buelta siguiendo su viage; y que los dhos
yngleses prisioneros avian declarado que cerca de alli en la
misma ysla de Guadalupe a la banda del sur, estava surta la
armada de la reyna de yngalaterra, y aprestando lanchas con
veinte y cinco navios, los seis de los galeones de la reyna de 800<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
toneladas y otros dos del mesmo porte de particulares, y todos
en dos esquadras, y por generales Franᵒ. Draque y Juan Aquines,
governando la derota y cosas de tierra Franᵒ. Draque y su
lugarteniente en tierra Don Thomas Vasquezarfil; y que traia
la armada 30<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> infantes y 10,500 marineros bien artillados, y
que venian derechos a Puerto rico, como parecia por la ynstruccion
que se le tomo al capitan del dho navio yngles en la qual se
le ordeno en caso que por alguno forçoso se apartase, viniese
a Puerto rico, donde le aguardarian 10 dias, y que alli se
dexarian orden adonde avian de yr despues, sin declarar otro
disegno; y que conforme a esto el dho Don Pedro venia
temeroso que no ubiese venido delante y estubiese ganada la
tierra, y que puesto no avia sido, tenia por cierto que aes otro
dia estaria sobre el puerto, y que conforme a esto el general
ordenase su partida como mas pareciese combenir.</p>

<p>Visto el general Sancho Pardo la relacion del dho Don
Pedro Tello y su Almirante Gonçalo Mendez y que esta
nueba le allava en la cama y indispuesto de enfermidad,
de algunos dias avia estava con ella, hiço avisar a Obispo y
al governador, pidiendoles se viesen con el y los capitanes
de fragatas Marco Antonio Becerra, cabo de la compania de
Arcabuçeros, y Pedro de Guia del avito de San Juan,
y Domingo de Ynsaurraga, Franᵒ. Gomez, capitan deste
presidio, y el veedor Martin Vomero de Caamaño, Juan de la
Vera, contador de las fragatas; y todos juntos en su posada
y aviendo tratado y propuesto el dho general la relacion que
tenia del enemigo y los medios mas combenientes que avia
por la seguridad de la tierra y plata; supuesto que la armada
enemiga era tanta y esperarse tan breve, y que las fragatas
precisamente tenian necesidad de adereçarse y meter agua y
leña y embarcarse la plata en que se avian de detener ocho
dias por lo menos, y considerando que el enemigo quando
estuviese con esta ocupacion, y quando no por el aviso que le<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
pudo dar el otro navio que se vio, que estas fragatas venian
por la plata que ya savia que estava aqui, la podia esperar al
paso, oque de la tierra se podia apoderar y fortificarse en ella
para conquistar a todas las Yndias, en que a su Magestad
leseguia gran perjucio y daño de su reputacion.</p>

<p>Todos de unanime conformes acordaron que la tierra se
fortificase con la artilleria y gente, y que la nao capitana de
tierra firme y otro de Pedro Milanes se echasen a fondo en
la canal del puerto para çegar la entrada, y que la plata no se
mudase de la fortaleça asta ver como las cosas se ponian,
pareciendo estara alli mas segura y en parte donde quando
per nuestros pecados se lo ordenava, se pudiera echar al a mar
paraque no la goçase el enemigo, y con esta resolucion sean
ydo poniendo en execution con mucha priesa y diligencia
de noche y de dia todas prevençiones posibles.</p>

<p>El general Sancho Pardo como persona de tanta experientia
y que tenia visto y reconoçido los sitios y puertos de la tierra,
aseguro al dho Don Pedro Tello y a los que con el venian,
que era caso ymposible perderse la tierra quiriendo los
nuestros pelear y haçer el deber, y que solo avia tener
cuidado del puerto, que la armada no se metiese de golpe, y
que par eso era bien se echasen a fondo las dos naos que
estava acordado, y en sus espaldas las fragatas con las proas
a la mar par resistir la entrada, y que con eso estava segura
la tierra y plata de su Magestad, de que seria muy servido,
en cuyo nombre les pedio acudiesen a sus obligaciones; y para
esto Don Pedro Tello tomo a su cargo la defensa del puerto.</p>

<p>El Obispo offreçio de deçir el otro dia una misa y una
platica ala gente, como lo hiço, christianamente encargandole
el serviçio de Dios y de su rey, y siempre continuo este officio
de noche y de dia visitando los puestos donde la gente estava,
puniendo en cada uno un saçerdote y animandolos con
mucho exfuerço.</p>

<p>Este dia el governador y general despacharon un barco
con aviso a sancto Domingo para que se pusiesen y estubiesen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
a la mira por si el enemigo yba alla como se entiende
y se le escrivio al Presidente, que luego avisase lo mismo a
Cartagena y a Sancta Maria.</p>

<p>Luego se hiço muestra de toda la gente de la tierra, y
parte de la que avia en las fragatas se desembarco por ser
necesario para la tierra; allose en todo a 10,300 personas y
en estos 700 de pelea y los 800 de fragatas y capitana de
tierra firme, y las demas del presidio y forasteros, en los
quales avia 50 de a cavallo con lança y adarga, que todo se
repartieron en la forma siguiente:</p>

<p class="noindent">y las fragatas bien artilladas; sin las quales avia las dhas
setenta pieças de artilleria plantadas y buenos artilleros en
cada puesto y por sobreestante de los fuertes del morro y
morillo de sancta Elena, el Almirante Gonçalo Mendez de
Canço.</p>

<p>A los 15 del dho llego aviso dal governador de Canaria
despachado al de aqui, para que supiese como la armada
enemiga avia pasado por alli y aviendo echado alguna gente
en tierra para haçer agua, le avian echo retirar con daño de
veinte y çinco personas, y que venia la buelta de las yndias; y
el dho aviso dijo como al pasar por la ysla de san Martin avia
visto surta la armada con veinte y çinco velas.</p>

<p>Luego el dho dia el General Sancho Pardo despacho el
mismo al governador de la Avana y le escrivio avisase a
nueva España al general Pedro Melendez que estava alla con
su flota. Estando echas todas estas preventiones toda la
gente deseosa de verse con el enemigo, entraron en consejo
el dho general y Don Pedro Tello, y el Almirante Gonçalo
Mendez y los capitanes Marco Antonio Veçerra, Pedro de
Guia, Domingo de Ynsaurraga, el vehedor Martin Vomero
de Caamaño, y aviendo tratado si seria bien embarcar la
plata en dos fragatas, para que en caso que el enemigo se
pusiese sobre el puerto, como mas lijeras se pudiesen escapar
de noche, siguiendoles las otras tres en reta guardia, para que
si se ofreçiese quedasen peleando y las dos siguiesen su viage;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
los mas Votos conformaronse enque no se mudase la plata
de donde estava, porque seria desanimar la gente de la tierra
que estava con animo de defenderla peleando, y viendo que
los desemparavan sedesanimarian y su Magestad perderia la
tierra y su reputacion, enque le iba a deçir mucho mas de lo
que le importava la plata; que lo que conbenio era haçer
rostro al enemigo confiando en Dios que nos daria victoria;
y visto por el general la mayor parte de los pareceres, ordeno
a Don Pedro Tello que con diligencia aprestase las fragatas,
para quando lo estubiese y combiniese embarcar la plata se
hiçiese, en el entretanto que el enemigo daria muestras de si
por si estubiese esperando al passo, mando fuese una carabela
la buelta de la mar 50 leguas a descubrir; y ansi se hiço y la
plata se estubo queda que fue bien açertado.</p>

<p>Miercoles 22 del dho mes de Nobiembre al amaneçer se
descubrio la armada enemiga a la vista de tierra con 23 velas
y una carabela latina, las 6 galeones de la reyna de 800 toneladas,
y dos naos del mismo porte y los demas navios de 300,
y de 150, y de ayavajo y 40 lanchas venian navegando bien
recogidas. Luego se toco a arma y cada qual acudio a su puesto
con mucha alegria y buen animo de pelear. El viento era
poco y asi venia con espacio asta que entro la briça. Venia
delante la carabela latina y algunas lanchas soldando la
costa con vanderas blancas en señal, y llegandose una enfrente
del boqueron, le tiraron de alli con una pieça que la hiçieron
retirar a la mar y luego pusieron otras vanderas coloradas; y
pasando delante despues del medio dia, dio fondo toda la
armada enfrente de la caleta del cabron donde jamas se vio
surgir ningun navio por ser costa y donde no se savia que
se podia dar fondo asta despues de ser ydo el enemigo, que
embio el general a sondar la parte donde estubo y se allo de
20 a 30 braças en limpio, y segun lo que se entendio era su
fin echar alli gente de vajo de su artilleria, pareçiendole
allarnos desaperçevidos y que no ubiese ninguna muestra
que se le resistiese el paso, y allose engañado.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>Estando junta la dha Armada en la parte que digo, los
nuestros le tiraron muchas pieças de artilleria del morrillo y
de la caleta del cabron, tanto que algunas valas le hiçieron
dano por lo que despues que se supo que le mataron a Juan
Aquines, general de la una esquadra y a dos caballeros de los
principales que con el venian y otra gente, y que a Franᵒ.
Draque le llevaron la mesa en que estava comiendo y la bala
dio a un personage que con el venia que se supo no escapara.</p>

<p>Viendo el enemigo el dano que de tierra se le haçia, embio
la carabela latina con un piloto ysléno de naçion mulato que
dicen es muy platico en estas partes, llevando consigo cinco
lanchas la buelta del puerto a reconeçerle y a sondar junto
la boca del ysloto que llaman ysla de Cabras, que esta a la
vanda del oeste, y despues de aver fondado volvio la una
lancha a dar aviso a la armada, la qual se desalojo luego de
alli a las cinco de la tarde, sin aver tirado pieça ni un solo
mosquete en todo el tiempo que alli estubo, y se fue buelta
de la mar, y de una y otra se andubo aquella noche asta
otro dia.</p>

<p>Juebes siguiente a las ocho de la mañana fue a surgir toda
la armada al socayre del yslote que el dia antes avian soldado
junto al puerto, que fue otro nuebo surgidero no conoçido
asta entonçes por ser fondo de 60 braças sobre bajos subjeto
a que con qualquiera tiempo de braveça se pudiera perder en
la costa. Alli estubo siendole el tiempo favorable, sin poder la
alcançar nuestra artilleria, y aquella tarde embio dos lanchas a
asondar la playa de vayamon asta la estacada del carivelo y a
reconeçer aquellos vajos para ver si por alli podria echar gente
en tierra, y en la una lancha bein entoldada fue Franᵒ.
Draque por lo que despues se supo.</p>

<p>Visto por Don Pedro Tello, a cuyo cargo estava el puerto,
las diligencias que el enemigo haçia, y pareciendole que avia
de acometer por la estacada del carivelo rompiendola aquella
noche con lanchas para echar gente en tierra, acudio al
general a dar le quenta dello, y a pedirle gente para que<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
fuesen a defender a quel paso, y el general ordeno que
aquella tarde estubiese alli el capitan Agustin de Candecho
con 30 soldados y que a la noche fuesen 50 soldados a cargo
del vehedor Martin Vomero de Caamaño, con orden de que
si la fuerça del enemigo fuese superior, se retirase con la
gente en los barcos a las fragatas para haçerse fuertes en ellas.</p>

<p>El dicho jueves 23 dia de San Clemente a las 10 de la
noche con la obscuridad acometio el enemigo al puerto con
25 lanchas y en cada una de 50 a 60 personas bien armadas
con fin de quemar las fragatas segun lo que se vio, y todas
entraron arrimadas a la plata forma del morro, metiendose de
vajo de la artilleria, y segun lo que despues se supo, Franᵒ.
Draque vino en la una asta la boca del puerto, a meter las
demas, y aunque hacia obscuro se vieron las lanchas y luego
començo a jugar la artilleria del morro y del fuerte de sancta
elena y las fragatas muy a priesa, y las mas de las lanchas
embistieron con la fragata texeda Capitana poniendole fuego
por la proa, echandole dentro muchas alcançias, bombas de
fuego, y los nuestros con mucha diligencia lo apagaron sin
daño ninguno, peleando con artilleria, mosqueteria, piedras,
y al mismo tiempo pusieron fuego a la fragata sancta ysabel
y a la fragata Magdalena y a sancta clara, el qual se apago;
y la tercera vez que se encendio en la fragata magdalena de
que era capitan Domingo de Ynsaurraga, no se pudo apagar,
por averse encendido por popa con mucha furia, y todo lo
que dio lugar a poder estar en ella y pelear lo hiço el dho
capitan y la gente que con el se allo, astaque estava ya casi
quemada y muertas 12 personas de la mosqueteria del
enemigo, y otras tantas que se quemaron; y el dho capitan se
escapo a nado por medio de las lanchas, y se fue a la fragata
sancta Ysabel que estava a cargo del capitan Juan Flores de
Rabanal en lugar del capitan Pedro de Guia que tenia un
sitio de tierra a su cargo, y alli ayudo a todo lo que se ofreçio.
Duro el pelear una hora la mas reñida que sea visto, y
con el fuego de la fragata que se quemo, aclaro todo el<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
puerto de manera que fue bien para las demas que se
veian para asentar nra artilleria y la de los fuertes, con la
quel y con la mosqueteria y piedras que de las fragatas se
tiraron, les hicieron tanto daño que se retiraron acabo de
una ora que como digo se peleava, con perdida de 9 o 10
lanchas y mas de 400 personas sin otros muchos que fueron
heridos; no aviendo de nuestra parte mas de la perdida de
la fragata y quarenta personas muertas y quemadas, de la
mosqueteria algunos heridos. Fue muy de ver lo bien que
las fragatas pelearon y quan bien les acudio el artilleria de
los fuertes particularmente el de sancta elena que estava
mas amano para ofender las lanchas.</p>

<p>Viernes 24, considerando que el enemigo avia de asegundar
aquella noche y que avia de echar gente en tierra, dende
que amaneçio no çesaron prevençiones por nuestra parte,
plantando artilleria en algunos puertos de tierra como fue en
todo el tejar, que estava a cargo del governador y del Capitan
Marco Antonio con la gente del cuerpo de guardia; en la
caleta de sancta Catalina se paso el capitan Guia que antes
estava en el morrillo con 50 arcabujeros, y en la caleta de los
frayles junto a la fortaleça otros dos pieças y 30 soldados a
cargo del vehedor Martin Vomero, y en todas partes se
hiçieron muchas trincheras y fortificaçiones trabajando cada
qual con el açadon en la mano, sin que hubiese negro que a
ello ayudase, porque todos los veçinos los embiaron al monte
con sus aciendas y mugeres luego que asomo el enemigo.</p>

<p>Toda via como a las 8 de la mañana con el terral se levo
la armada enemiga buelta a la mar procurando ponerse a
barlobento del puerto, y ansi andubo asta la tarde y pareçiendole
a Don Pedro Tello que esto era para entrarse de
golpe en el puerto, fue a tierra a deçirle al general que le
pareçia que el enemigo se venia derecho al puerto, y que con
los dos naos que se avian echado a fondo, no estava del todo
çerrado la canal y que combenia echar dos fragatas en la
parte que estava libre para que del todo se ympidiese la entrada,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
pues era de tanta importancia a segurar el puerto que
las dos fragatas por muchas considerationes y bien del
serviçio de su Magestad.</p>

<p>El general Sancho Pardo hiço luego junta del governador
y de mas ministros, y luego acordaron que se hechase una
fragata a fondo en la canal a caso que no bastase un navio de
Pedro Sedeño que estava cargado de mercadurias y otro de
menos porte, los quales se echasen luego como estavan, pues
el brebedad del tiempo no daba lugar a la descarga, y que la
fragata se echase quando el dho Don Pedro le pareçiese
combenir.</p>

<p>A las 4 de la tarde venia el enemigo con la briça caminando
açia el puerto y creyendo Don Pedro Tello que venia derecho a
el, echo a fondo los dos navios de Sedeño y Juan Diaz de
Sancta Aña, y la fragata tejeda, sin que la brebedad del tiempo
diese lugar a sacarle todos los bastimentos y artilleria, aunque
alguna parte se saco, y con esto se çerro toda la entrada de la
canal, y el enemigo a la oraçion surgio entre el morro y la
ysla de cabras donde estubo surto la noche antes.</p>

<p>Visto que la armada estava surta y mas cerca de la
entrada del puerto, se volvio a confirmar la sospecha que se
tenia de que aquella noche avia de procurar acabar de
quemar las fragatas y echar gente en tierra: Don Pedro Tello
con acuerdo del general hiço retirar las tres fragatas el
puerto adentro, y las metieron en el tejar con gente de
guardia por asegurarlas y no temiendo que echasen gente en
tierra, viendo quan bien dispuestos estavan los animos de los
nuestros y todos los sitios y desembarcaderos atrincherados y
fuertes; y el retirar las fragatas fue ya de noche quando el
enemigo no lo pudo ver, y ansi el otro dia por la mañana entendio
que todas las avia echado a fondo aquella noche, se
estubo sosegado sin haçer ninguna demostraçion por nuestra
parte si bien estubimos a la mira.</p>

<p>Sabado 25 luego de mañana embio el enemigo siete o ocho
lanchas a reconoçer el puerto y toda la costa asta el boqueron,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
desbiandose de tierra porque nuestra artilleria no los ofendiese
y a las 10 de la mañana volvieron a recojerse a la
armada que estava junta en la parte dicha.</p>

<p>Este dia a las dos de la tarde asomo nuestra carabela que
avia ydo ocho dias antes a descubrir el enemigo, y como por
los nuestros fue vista le tiraron una pieça del boqueron para
que se recojiese sin yr al puerto, y de la armada le siguieron
algunas lanchas asta la playa de cangrejos donde baro y parte
de la cavalleria acudio a socorrer la gente, y Franᵒ. Gonçalez
que venia por piloto y capitan de la dha carabela le saco un
rumbo porque el enemigo no la llevase y ansi las lanchas se
alargaron y se bolvieron sin açer pressa.</p>

<p>El dho sabado en la noche se hiço a la bela toda la armada
sin ser vista y se fue a la mar, y viendo los nuestros a la
mañana que no parecia, se embio luego personas por tierra prolongando
la costa del oeste, para que viesen si pareçia o avia
pasado por alli, como se entendia, y yba a Sancto Domingo.</p>

<p>Lunes volvio un aviso del Arracivo catorçe leguas deste
puerto, diçiendo que la armada avia pasado por alli su camino
adelante. Este dia despacho el governador otro aviso a San
German, el qual bolvio dentro de seis dias con nueba de que
la armada estava en el butiro de la açucar la otra vanda de
San German, y que avia echado en tierra cinco compañias de
piqueros y mosqueteros que estavan açiendo carne, agua y
leña, y quatro lanchas los quales hiço en quatro dias por traer
lo mas echo.</p>

<p>Aviendo el general visto estos avisos y pareçiendole que
podria ser odio del enemigo, y que de alli podria ponerse al
monte en espera de las dhas fragatas, o querer que fuesen
ydas para volver sobre puerto rico por allarle sin fuerça para
apoderarse del y executar el designio que traya de fortificarse
en el, toco a cuerdo de lo que se aria, y se resolvio que no se
saliesen del puerto asta saver de cierto que el enemigo hubiese
pasado adelante de la punta de la Aguada, y que fuese el
Capitan Juan Flores de Rabanal con un pataje 70 v 80 leguas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
la buelta del norte a descubrir, y que se embarcase la plata en
el entretanto, el qual volvio a cabo de ocho dias sin aver visto
nada.</p>

<p>A nueve de diciembre vino aviso de San German que la
armada enemiga era yda la buelta del Sur.</p>

<p>A once del dho llego asta çiudad Lope Sanchez contramaestre
de la fragata Magdalena y quatro marineros della,
que la noche del yncendio de las fragatas los prendieron en
el agua las lanchas del enemigo. A los quales echo en tierra
en el butrio de la azucar con una carta de Franᵒ. Draque
para el governador de aqui, cuya copia es la que sigue;</p>

</div>

<p>Por relaçion que el dho contramaestre y demas marineros<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
que ocho dias andubieron con el enemigo, se supo que salieron
de alli la buelta del sur o del susudueste, y que yban a
Sancto Domingo y de alli a Panama, porque deçian que yban
adonde avia mucho oro y plata, y ansi se deja entender por
las muchas lanchas que llevaron pertrechos de guerra. Estos
çertificaron la muerte de Juan Aquines y el sentimiento que
por el se hiço y el mucho daño que los enemigos reçivieron,
tanto que pasandolos un dia de la capitana a otro galeon,
allaron casi la gente del toda herida y maltratada, y que se
quejaban del daño que las piedras que les tiraron de las fragatas
les hiço, y que fue tanto el mal que el otro dia de la
pelea Franᵒ. Draque hiço consejo sobre si segundaria, no hallo
ninguno que fuese de su pareçer, y mas por averles dhos estes
hombres que era mucha la fuerça que teniamos mas de la
que a sido; y que el Draque se quedo esbentado quando supo
la poca gente que se hallo en las fragatas la noche del fuego,
y se tiraba de las barbas por no aver tomado la plata y la
tierra, no se dejando ver aquellos dos dias, quejandose de Juan
Aquines que no quiso que vineran tras las fragatas de la ysla
de Guadalupe luego que supo que le avian cojido el navio y
venian a puerto rico, dando a entender que no tubieramos
lugar de fortificarmos como se hiço en los ocho dias que se
tardaron en aprestar sus lanchas y en haçer agua. Todo lo a
ordenado Dios a quien se debe dar muchas graçias, pues mediante
su labor de mas de aver alcançado una victoria tel, con
tan poca gente como de nuestra parte hubo resistiendo la
fuerça de una armada tan poderosa, defendiendo la tierra y
dos millones de plata, a su Magestad selea seguido notables
serviçios y a los particulares bien general.</p>

<p>Lo primero, que por lo que sea entendido el enemigo traya
fin de sustentar esta fuerça y fuera le facil con poca costa,
porque los cosarios que andan en esto de todas naçiones seacojieran
a ella y ellos ayudara a defenderla, y fuera menester
armar muy de proposito para bolverse la a ganar, por ser el
serviçio del puerto fuerte y de donde mas daño pueden haçer
a yslotas y costas que todo lo tiene a sotavento.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Lo segundo, que a este enemigo, que asta oy nadie lea echo
resistençia en la mar, aqui se le rompio la caveça, pues como
esta dho, una de las dos que governaban murio y 400 personas
y hubo muchos heridos.</p>

<p>Lo 3, que se escaparon dos millones de plata y oro y
granas con que la Reyna podia armar y entretenerse por mas
ynquietar nos.</p>

<p>Lo 4, que con averse entretenido en estas yslas asta los 3
de Diçiembre, dio tiempo a que sepuedan aver prevenido los
lugares sospechosos con los avisos que esta dho sedespacharon
a Sancto Domingo y a la avana, y destos los avian tenido en
Cartagena y nueba espana con que podemos esperar seguridad.</p>

<p>Lo ultimo, y no demenos consideraçion es el animo y reputaçion
que los nuestros an cobrado, reconoçiendo el poco
valor de los enemigos, y por el contrario la opinion que ellos
an perdido, en que consiste mucha parte de los buenos o malos
subçesos, y pues desta se siguen tantos viénes, su Magestad
debe haçer merced a los que en el se allaron para que los que
estan a la mira se animen a servirle en semeyantes ocasiones.</p>

<p>Pasada esta como esta dho, y aviendo el general tenido
aviso que el enemigo yba adelante, y que los vastimentos eran
pocos por averse gastado muchos en esta ocasion, y ser la
miseria desta ysla tal que no se podian proveer otros, y que
combenia abreviar la partida de sudespacho, y ordeno que
con suma presteça se recojiese el artilleria de los puestos de
tierra y se embarcase la plata en los fragatas, y con ellas y
con un navio y un patache en que se embarco parte de la
gente y artilleria de las dos fragatas perdidas y de la capitana
de tierra firme, partio de puerto rico con buen tiempo a los
20 de Diçiembre de 1595.</p>

PUERTO RICO, IN THE INDIES, WITH THE ENGLISH<br />
FLEET UNDER THE COMMAND OF FRANCIS DRAKE<br />
AND JOHN HAWKINS, on the 23rd NOVEMBER 1595.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="center">(<i>The Translation of the preceding document.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent">General Sancho Pardo y Osorio having taken his departure
from the Havana for Spain on the 10th March of this year,
in command of the Capitana of the main-land fleet, under
convoy of the armed fleet of Don Francisco de Coloma, and
having, in the course of the gale which blew in the chops of
the Channel on the 15th of the same month, in latitude
23° 30´, found himself without a main-mast, and with tiller
broken, while the ship, leaking much, and separated from the
others, was no longer in a condition to prosecute the voyage,
for the purpose of saving the lives of the three hundred people
who were on board, as well as two millions of gold and silver
belonging to His Majesty and to private individuals; with
the advice and consent of the supercargo, Martin Vomero de
Caamaño, and of the pilots and other persons of most experience
on board, made for Puerto Rico, where he arrived, by a
miracle, on the 9th April, and there he landed the bullion,
and deposited it in the fortress of the town. The aforesaid
general despatched immediately first and second advices to
His Majesty, making known his arrival, in order that instructions
might be sent to him as to what he should do.
And it appears that Divine Providence (to whom many
thanks are due), for its secret ends, permitted the orders,
which might have come beforehand, to arrive just at the time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
to save not only the bullion, but the island itself, and perhaps
all the Indies, as will be seen further on.</p>

<p>A few days after the aforesaid letters were despatched,
the governor of this island, Colonel Pedro Suares, received
those of His Majesty, whereby he was informed that a great
fleet was fitting out in England for the purpose of seizing on
this island in the course of the winter, as it was thought that
at that season the inhabitants would be less upon their guard.
When the general and the aforesaid supercargo learned the
contents of these despatches, they joined in consultation
with the governor and Francisco Cid, captain of the infantry
of this garrison; and having taken into consideration and
discussed the precautionary measures which ought to be
adopted for the safety of the place and of His Majesty’s
treasure, in order that, if the enemy should come, it might
be out of his power to make himself master of the whole,
they all agreed on reconnoitering the positions and accessible
points from which the enemy might approach, so as to throw
people ashore; and also that the general should give orders
for planting some of the guns of his ship in the positions
which he judged best, and for laying the vessel athwart the
channel of the port, so that she might be sunk on the arrival
of the enemy, and thus bar the entrance; as this was the
quarter where there seemed most likelihood of attack and
most risk, and where it was necessary to keep the people
well on the watch. These arrangements being made, the
general remained in expectation of His Majesty’s order to
proceed on his voyage.</p>

<p>On the 13th November of this year, there arrived at this
port, Don Pedro Tello de Guzman, with the five frigates of
His Majesty, in order that General Sancho Pardo should
embark in them His Majesty’s bullion, and so proceed to
Spain, the post of Admiral of his fleet being filled by the
aforesaid Pedro Tello, who, after having delivered his despatches,
related to the aforesaid general, how, coming here in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
the course of his voyage, they had fallen in with two English
ships at the island of Guadaloupe, which had parted company
from the English fleet; and how his Admiral, Gonzalo Mendez
de Canço, had captured one of them and sunk her, after
taking the Englishmen out of her; and that he, the aforesaid
Don Pedro, going in pursuit of the other vessel, discovered
nine sail of the enemy’s fleet, and as soon as he descried
them he tacked about and continued his voyage: and that
the aforesaid English prisoners had stated that thereabouts,
on the southern side of the island of Guadaloupe, the Queen
of England’s fleet was lying at anchor and preparing launches;
that it consisted of five-and-twenty ships, six of them
Queen’s galleons of eight hundred tons burden, and two
more of the same size belonging to private parties, the whole
being divided into two squadrons, having for generals,
Francis Drake and John Hawkins; the former, with his
lieutenant in command on shore, Sir Thomas Baskerville,
directing the course to be taken, and the proceedings on
land; and that the armament amounted to three thousand
infantry and ten thousand five hundred seamen well supplied
with guns; and that they were coming direct to Puerto Rico,
as appeared also from the instructions which were taken
from the captain of the aforesaid English ship, in which he
was ordered, in case he should part company from the fleet
by any mischance, to proceed to Puerto Rico, where they
would wait for him ten days, and after that, would leave
orders for him where he was to go, without further revealing
their intentions; and that in consequence of all this, the
aforesaid Don Pedro came, fearing that the enemy might
have preceded him and already got possession of the island;
and since they had not yet come, he held it for certain that
they would be down upon the port the next day; and accordingly
it lay with the general to order his departure as it
might seem expedient.</p>

<p>When the general, Sancho Pardo, heard the statement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
made by the aforesaid Don Pedro Tello and his admiral,
Gonzalo Mendez; and inasmuch as that news reached him
when he was confined to his bed by an illness under which he
had been suffering some days, he sent word to the Bishop
and to the Governor, requesting them to come to him to
meet the captains of the frigates,—Marco Antonio Becerra,
head of the company of fusileers; and Pedro de Guia, of the
order of St. John; and Domingo de Ynsaurraga; Francisco
Gomez, captain of this garrison; the supercargo, Martin
Vomero de Caamaño, and Juan de la Vera, purser of the
frigates. These having all met together in his house, the
general laid before them and submitted for their consideration
the account which he had of the enemy, and the best
means that offered for the security of the island and the
bullion, supposing that the enemy’s fleet was as great, and
to be expected as soon as was said; and that the frigates
absolutely required to have their rigging repaired and to
take in wood and water, which, with embarking the bullion,
would cause a delay of eight days at the least; and considering
that, whether they were so occupied or not, the enemy by
reason of the information which that other ship that was seen
could give him, that these frigates were coming for the treasure,
which was now known to be here, might hope to seize
it on the passage, or to make himself master of the country
and to fortify himself in it, with a view to the conquest of all
the Indies, whence would ensue to His Majesty great injury
and loss of reputation.</p>

<p>All were of one mind in thinking that the place ought to
be strengthened with the guns and crews of the ships, and that
the Capitana de Tierra Firme and another ship belonging to
Pedro Milanes, should be sunk in the channel of the port, to
shut the entrance, and that the bullion should not be moved
from the fort until it was seen what turn affairs would take,
as it appeared to be safer there, and in a position also,
whence (if, for our sins, it should be so ordered) it might be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
more easily thrown into the sea, so that the enemy should
not get it; and having thus resolved, they proceeded to carry
into execution with great alacrity and zeal, night and day,
every possible measure of defence.</p>

<p>General Sancho Pardo, as a person of great experience,
and who had seen and examined the position and approaches
of the place, assured Don Pedro Tello and the others who
came with him, that the loss of the place was out of the
question if our people were only willing to fight and do their
duty, and that it was only necessary to take good care of the
port, so as to prevent the enemy’s fleet running into it at
once; and that, for that purpose, it were as well to sink the
two ships which had been agreed on, and on top of them, the
frigates with their bows towards the sea to bar the entrance,
and that with this precaution the place was quite safe and
also the treasure of His Majesty, who, herein, would be well
served, and in whose name he called on them to attend to
their several duties; and accordingly Don Pedro Tello took
under his own charge the defence of the port.</p>

<p>The Bishop offered to say mass the next day, and to
preach a sermon to the people, as he did in fact, exhorting
them, in a Christian manner, to the service of God and of
their king; and he persevered in the performance of this
office night and day, visiting the posts where the people
were stationed, placing a priest at each of them, and animating
his hearers with much zeal.</p>

<p>The same day, the governor and general despatched a
barque with advices to St. Domingo, that the inhabitants of
that island might set and keep themselves on the watch; so
that if the enemy were to go there, as was heard and was
written to the President, the information might be immediately
forwarded to Cartagena and Sancta Maria.</p>

<p>All the people of the island were immediately mustered,
and some of those belonging to the frigates were landed,
being thought necessary for the defence of the posts. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
whole amounted to ten thousand three hundred souls, of
whom seven hundred were fighting men, besides the eight
hundred belonging to the frigates and the Capitana of the
main-land, and the rest of the garrison, and foreigners, including,
also, fifty on horseback with lance and buckler; the
whole of whom were distributed in the following manner:</p>

<p class="noindent">Besides the frigates well armed, without which there were the
aforesaid seventy pieces of cannon planted with good gunners
at each post, and for chief commander of the forts of the
Morro and the Morillo de Sta. Helena, the Admiral, Gonçalo
Mendez de Canço.</p>

<p>On the 15th of the same month intelligence arrived from
the governor of Canary, despatched to the governor of this
island, to make it known that the enemy’s fleet had passed
by the former place, and having landed some people for the
purpose of watering, they had been forced to retreat with the
loss of five-and-twenty men, and had gone off towards the
Indies; and the same messenger stated, that in passing by the
island of St. Martin, he had seen the armada, of five-and-twenty
sail, lying at anchor.</p>

<p>Immediately, on the same day, the general, Sancho Pardo,
sent the same despatch to the governor of the Havana, and
wrote to him to forward the information to New Spain to
General Pedro Melendez, who was on that coast with his
fleet. These precautionary steps having been taken, and
the people being all eager to combat the enemy, the general
held a council, at which were present, Don Pedro Tello; the
admiral, Gonçalo Mendez; and the captains, Marco Antonio
Veçerra, Pedro de Guia, and Domingo de Ynsaurraga, with
the supercargo Martin Vomero de Caamaño; and having
taken into consideration whether it were expedient to embark
the bullion in two of the frigates, so that if the enemy
should place himself before the port, these being lighter,
might effect their escape by night, the other three following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
them in the rear, in order that, if any attempt were made
upon them, they might stay behind fighting while the two
continued their voyage; it was decided by the majority of
votes, that the bullion should not be removed from the place
where it was lying, because the removal of it would tend to
dispirit the people, who were fired with the thought of defending
it: seeing their expectations foiled, they would be
dispirited, and His Majesty would lose the place and his
reputation, which was to be valued much more highly than the
bullion: and what it behoved them to do, was to face the
enemy, trusting in God for the victory. When the general
saw how the majority inclined, he gave orders to Don Pedro
Tello to get the frigates ready with all convenient despatch,
that the bullion might be embarked whenever it was found
expedient to do so; the enemy, it was supposed, would afford
indications of his intentions, if he had such, of watching for
it outside; and he directed that a caravel should cruise on
the look out, about fifty leagues off the land. This was
done accordingly, and the bullion remained as it was, which
was the prudent course.</p>

<p>Wednesday the 22nd of the same month (November), at
break of day, the enemy’s fleet was descried on the horizon,
with twenty-three sail and a pinnace. The six queen’s
galleons of eight hundred tons, and two ships of the same
size, and the rest, vessels of three hundred tons and of one
hundred and fifty and less, and forty launches, came sailing
in close order. Immediately every one snatched up his arms
and ran to his post with great alacrity, and well disposed for
combat. There was but little wind, and so the fleet advanced
but slowly till it entered the breeze. The pinnace came first
and some boats with white signal-flags sounding the coast.
One of them having come in front of the Boqueron battery,
a gun was fired at it which made it stand off to sea, and they
immediately hoisted other coloured flags and passed out; and
in the afternoon the whole fleet came and cast anchor in front<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of the curtain of the Cabron, where no one had ever seen a
ship ride before, nor was it known that there was good anchorage
till after the departure of the enemy, when the
general sent to have the place sounded, and from twenty to
thirty fathoms clear water were found there. From what
was learned, it appears to have been his intention to land a
force under the fire of his artillery, imagining that he should
find us unprepared, and seeing no reason to believe that
such a step would meet with resistance; wherein he was
mistaken.</p>

<p>The fleet having arrived in the place above-mentioned, our
people fired at it several pieces of artillery from the Morrillo
and the curtain of the Cabron, so that some of the shot took
effect on them, for it was known afterwards, that they killed
John Hawkins, the general of one of the squadrons, and two
of the principal gentlemen who accompanied him, besides
other people; and that they carried away the table at which
Francis Drake was eating, the ball striking a gentleman who
was with him, and who, it is known, will not escape.</p>

<p>The enemy perceiving how much loss he sustained from
the shore, sent the pinnace with a pilot, a native of the islands
and a mulatto by race, who is said to be practically well
acquainted with these coasts, with five boats to the port, to
reconnoitre it and to sound close to the mouth formed by the
islet, which is called Goat Island, which lies towards the
west; and when it was sounded, one of the boats returned
with information to the fleet, which immediately weighed
anchor, at five o’clock in the evening, without having fired a
cannon or even a musket during all the whole time that it
was there, and ran out to sea, where it stood off and on that
night till the following day.</p>

<p>Thursday following, at eight o’clock in the morning, the
whole fleet came and anchored on the windward side of the
small island where they had been sounding the day before,
close to the port; and this was another new anchorage not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
known hitherto, and having six fathoms over shoals, where a
vessel might be easily lost in any bad weather. There the
fleet anchored, the weather being favourable, and beyond the
reach of our artillery; and the same evening two boats were
sent to sound the shore by the river Bayamon as far as the
Carivelo stockade, and to examine these shoals in order to
see if it were possible to land a force in that quarter; and in
one of the boats, which was covered closely with an awning,
was Francis Drake, as was subsequently learned.</p>

<p>When Don Pedro Tello, who had charge of the port, saw
the pains the enemy was taking, and perceived that an attack
was about to be made that very night on the stockade of
the Carivelo, by forcing it with boats, so as to land a body of
men, he sent to the general to acquaint him with what was
going on, and to ask for a reinforcement to resist such an
attempt; and the general ordered that in the evening Captain
Augustin de Candecho should proceed thither with
thirty soldiers, and that at night there should be fifty soldiers
under the command of the supercargo, Martin Vomero de
Caamaño, with orders that if the enemy’s force should prove
superior, he should retreat with his men in boats to the
frigates, in which their forces were to be concentrated.</p>

<p>The same Thursday, 23rd, St. Clement’s day, at ten o’clock
at night, when it was quite dark, the enemy commenced an
attack on the port with twenty-five boats, each carrying fifty
or sixty men well armed, with the view of burning the frigates,
as was afterwards seen, and they all entered close up
to the platform of the Rock [battery], ranging themselves
under the fire of the artillery; and from what was learned
afterwards, it appears that Francis Drake came in one of
them to the mouth of the port to place the rest. Dark as it
was, the boats were seen, and instantly the guns from the
Rock and from the fort of Sta. Helena began to play as
briskly as possible. Most of the boats attacked the Capitana,
the Texeda frigate, setting fire to her at the bow, and throwing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
into her a quantity of fire-pots and shells, while ours
succeeded in extinguishing the flames before they had done
any damage, the fight being carried on with cannon, musquetry,
and stones.</p>

<p>At the same time they set fire to the Sta. Ysabel and
Magdalena frigates, and to the Sancta Clara, which was
extinguished; but the third time that the Magdalena frigate,
of which Domingo de Ynsaurraga was captain, took fire, it
was impossible to extinguish the flames, as the ship took fire
at the stern and burned furiously; and all that could be
done to maintain a footing on board, was done by the aforesaid
captain and the people with him, until the ship was just
burnt down and twelve men were killed by the enemy’s
musquetry, besides as many more burnt. And the aforesaid
captain made his escape by swimming through the midst of
the boats and reached the frigate Sancta Ysabel, which was
under the command of Captain Juan Flores de Rabanal in
place of Captain Pedro de Guia, who had charge of a post
on land, and there he lent his assistance in every manner
possible. The battle lasted for an hour, the most obstinately
contested that was ever seen, and the whole port was illumined
by the burning frigate in a manner favourable for the
rest, who could thus see to point our artillery and that of the
forts, with which, and with the musquetry and the stones
thrown from the frigate, they did such effect, that the enemy,
after about an hour, during which the combat lasted, as I
have said, retreated with the loss of nine or ten boats and
more than four hundred men, besides many more wounded;
while on our side, the only loss was that of the frigate and
forty men killed or burnt, besides a few wounded by the
musquetry. It was a fine sight to see how the frigates fought,
and how capitally they were backed by the artillery of the
forts, particularly that of Sta. Helena, which was in an advantageous
position for playing on the boats.</p>

<p>Friday 24th. Considering that the enemy would assuredly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
repeat his attack at night, and endeavour to land his forces,
the people on our side never ceased, from the dawn of day,
to prepare for resistance, planting cannon at some passes on
land, as was done, for example, in the whole of the Tejar,
where the governor commanded, with Captain Marco Antonio
and the people forming the company of guards. Captain
Guia, who previously kept guard in the Morrillo, now took
his station in the curtain of Sancta Catalina with fifty
arquebusseers; in the curtain of the Friars, close to the fortress,
were two other pieces with thirty soldiers, under the
command of the supercargo, Martin Vomero, and on every
side numerous trenches were dug and defences constructed,
every one working spade in hand, and not a single negro to
assist, for the people round about had sent off all their slaves
to the mountain, with their effects and women, as soon as the
enemy appeared.</p>

<p>However, about eight o’clock in the morning, as soon as
the land breeze sprang up, the enemy’s fleet weighed and
stood to sea, endeavouring to get to windward of the port, and
continued on this course till evening; and Don Pedro Tello
perceiving that the object was to run at once into the port,
went ashore to explain to the general his apprehension that
the enemy was about to bear down directly on the place:
that the two ships which had been already sunk did not completely
close up the entrance to it, and that it was expedient
to sink two frigates in the part that still remained open,
inasmuch as the complete barring of the entrance and the
security of the port were quite as important as the two
frigates, for many reasons, and for the good of His Majesty’s
service.</p>

<p>General Sancho Pardo immediately held a council with
the governor and other officers, and they decided that one
frigate should be sunk in the channel, in case that a ship
belonging to Pedro Sedeño, which was lying there laden
with merchandise, and another of less size, should prove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
insufficient; that these should be sunk immediately, just as
they were, as there was not time to unload them, and that
the frigate should be sunk whenever Don Pedro thought
proper.</p>

<p>At four o’clock in the afternoon the enemy came running
down with the breeze towards the port, and Don Pedro Tello,
believing that he was making directly for it, sank the two
vessels of Sedeño and Juan Diaz de Sancta Aña, and also the
Texeda frigate, without being able, owing to the short time
allowed, to take out of them all the provisions and guns,
although a part was saved; and thus the entrance of the
channel was completely closed, and about vesper time the
enemy came to anchor between the Rock and Goat island,
where he had lain at anchor the night before.</p>

<p>The circumstance that the fleet anchored, and nearer than
before to the port, tended to confirm the suspicion that the
enemy meant to attempt that very night to finish the burning
of the frigates, and to land people. Don Pedro Tello,
therefore, with the consent of the governor, had the three
frigates brought back to the interior of the port, and they
were placed in the Tejar with a guard to secure them; but
he had no fears about the landing of a force, seeing the spirit
which animated our people, and that all the posts and landing-places
were well entrenched and strengthened. The removal
of the frigates took place at night, when the enemy
could see nothing, and consequently the next morning he
concluded that they had been all sunk. The night passed
off quietly, without any effort on our part to shew that we
were well on the watch.</p>

<p>Saturday the 25th, as soon as daylight appeared, the
enemy sent seven or eight boats to reconnoitre the port, and
all the shore as far as the Boqueron. These kept at a distance
from land, beyond the reach of our guns; and about
ten o’clock they returned to the fleet, which remained at
anchor in the place above-mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>The same day, about two o’clock in the afternoon, our
caravel, which had gone to look out for the enemy eight days
before, came in sight, and as soon as it was seen by our
people, they fired a gun from the Boqueron to warn it to
bear up without approaching the port; and some boats from
the fleet followed it as far as the Playa de Cangrejos (crab
ground), where it ran ashore, and part of the cavalry hastened
forward to assist the crew; and Francisco Gonçalez, who was
the pilot and captain of the caravel, scuttled her, to prevent
the enemy’s carrying her off; and so the boats went away,
and returned to the fleet without making a prize.</p>

<p>The same Saturday, at night, the whole fleet made sail
without being seen, and stood out to sea; and when we
found in the morning that it had disappeared, people were
sent by land westwards along the coast to ascertain whether
it was seen or had passed that way, as was supposed, and
was going to St. Domingo.</p>

<p>On Monday news arrived from Arracibo, fourteen leagues
from this port, that the fleet had passed by on its course.
The same day the general despatched another messenger to
San German, who returned within six days with the information
that the enemy’s fleet was lying in the Butiro de la
Azucar on the other side of San German, and that they had
landed five companies of pikemen and musqueteers, who were
collecting supplies of meat, wood, and water, and made four
boats in as many days to carry their supplies.</p>

<p>The general having received this intelligence, and thinking
it likely that there might be some artifice in the enemy’s
movements, who perhaps might be lying in wait hoping to
catch the two frigates, or intending to return upon Puerto Rico
when they should be gone and the place weakened, in order
that he might seize it, and execute his design of fortifying
himself in it, seriously deliberated as to what should be done,
and determined that the frigates should not quit the port till
it was known for certain that the enemy had passed Point de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
la Aguada; and that Captain Juan Flores de Rabanal should
go seventy or eighty leagues to the north with a patache to
look out, while the bullion was in the meantime embarking.
In eight days he returned, without having seen anything.</p>

<p>The 9th of December intelligence was brought from San
German that the enemy’s fleet had gone away southwards.</p>

<p>On the 11th of the same month there arrived at this place
Lope Sanchez, boatswain of the Magdalena frigate, and four
seamen of the same, who had been taken in the water by the
enemy’s boats, the night the frigates were set on fire. These
men had been put on shore in the Butiro de la Azucar, with
a letter of Francis Drake to the governor here, of which the
following is a copy:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">Letter of <span class="smcap">Francis Drake</span> to Colonel <span class="smcap">Pedro Suarez</span>,
Governor of Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>“Understanding that your lordship is a gentleman of rank
and a soldier, I write this letter to give you to understand
that whenever I have had an opportunity of dealing with the
Spanish nation, I have treated it with much honour and
clemency, liberating the individuals belonging to it, not a
few, but many in number. So, at the time when our people
set fire to the frigates, certain Spaniards were saved from the
fury of the flames, who, as conquered enemies, experienced
from us no ill-treatment, but the usage of honourable war.</p>

<p>“From them it has been learned that the capitana of Don
Pedro Tello took a small vessel of our fleet, having on board
twenty-five Englishmen, or more, treating them well, and as
might be expected in fair war. I myself still cherish my
former sentiments; but having another affair, strong deeds
are done, which never entered my mind. But as there are
in this place soldiers and gentlemen, I have no doubt that
my people will fare well, and will obtain their liberty for the
sake of honourable war: this I hope, and shall do the like
myself. I remain at your lordship’s service in all things,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
bating the cause which is to be maintained as that of the
flag of her sacred Majesty the queen of England.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Francis Drake.</span></p>

<p>“The 23d November 1595, English style.”</p>

</div>

<p>From the information given by the aforesaid boatswain
and the other seamen, who had gone with the enemy for
eight days, it was ascertained that the latter had departed
thence towards the S. or S.S.W., and that they were going to
St. Domingo and thence to Panama, for they said that they
were going where there was a quantity of gold and silver;
and the same thing might also be inferred from the number
of boats they took with them for an armament.</p>

<p>These men confirmed also the death of John Hawkins, and
testified as to the regret occasioned thereby, as well as to the
heavy loss which the enemy sustained. Thus, as a boat was passing
one day from the flag-ship to one of the other galleons, it
was struck, and nearly every man in it was wounded. They
stated that the enemy complained much of the damage done
by the stones thrown from the frigates; and that the loss was
so great, that when Francis Drake held a council the day after
the battle, to determine whether they should renew the attack,
there was not one who agreed with him in favour of that proposition,
especially as these men had told them that our force
was much greater than it used to be; and that Drake was
amazed when he learned how few people were on board of the
frigates the night of the fire, and plucked his beard [with vexation]
for not having taken the treasure and the place, not letting
himself be seen those two days; complaining of John
Hawkins, who did not allow them to pursue the three frigates
from the island of Guadaloupe, as soon as it was known that
they had taken the vessel and were making for Puerto Rico;
intimating that in that case we should not have had the opportunity
of fortifying the place, as was done in the eight days
which they spent in the delay of preparing boats, and watering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>All this has been so ordered by God, to whom we owe
many thanks, since by His means, besides obtaining such a
victory, with so small a force as that which on our side resisted
the efforts of so powerful an armament, in defence of
the place and two millions of treasure, important services
have resulted to his Majesty, and a general gain to private
individuals.</p>

<p>In the first place, as far as can be learned, it was the
enemy’s intention to maintain this force, which he might
easily do at small cost, for the pirates of all nations who frequent
these seas, would gather about him, and would aid
him in defending the position; and it would then be necessary
to fit out an expedition expressly to retake the place,
since the port has a decided advantage, and from thence
much injury may be easily done to the islands and coasts
which are to leeward.</p>

<p>In the second place, this enemy, who up to this time has
never met with any resistance at sea, has here had his head
broken; since, as has been related, one of the two leaders
died, with four hundred of his followers, and a great many
were wounded.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we have thus saved two millions worth of gold,
silver, and cochineal, with which the queen might equip and
maintain a force to give us further trouble.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the delaying of the enemy in these islands till
the 3rd December, allowed time for warning those places for
the safety of which fears might be entertained, by means of
the despatches which were sent, as has been stated, to St.
Domingo and the Havana, whence others were forwarded to
Carthagena and New Spain, so that we may now hope that
all is safe.</p>

<p>The last, and not the least consideration, is, the spirit
which our people have shewn, and the renown which they
have won, proving the inferiority of the enemy; and, on the
other hand, the hold on opinion which the latter have lost,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
and in which consists to a great extent the secret of good or
ill-success. And since the beneficial results of this affair are
so many, his Majesty ought to return thanks to those who
took part in it, in order that the lookers-on may be encouraged
to serve him on like occasions.</p>

<p>This affair having passed over as here related, and the
general having received information that the enemy was gone
on, and that provisions were scarce, a quantity of them
having been lost on this occasion, and the poverty of the
island being such that the deficiency could not be made good,
and that it was necessary for him to abridge his delay as
much as possible, gave orders to collect the guns with the
utmost despatch from the several posts on land, and to embark
the treasure in the frigates; and with these, one ship,
and a patache, in which were embarked part of the crews and
artillery of the two lost frigates, he left Puerto Rico with
good weather on the 20th December 1595.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">The Instructions given by F. Drake to the captain of the
Francis, one of the vessels of his fleet, which was taken at
the island of Guadaloupe.</p>

<p>The Instruction and Order to be observed by the whole
fleet, which departs from the port of Plymouth on the 29th
August 1595.</p>

<p>1. In the first place, omit not divine worship, and let this
order be observed twice a-day, unless no opportunity offers.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, great care must be taken to keep company
and to come to speak with your admiral twice a-day; and if
you cannot do it more than once, yet let it be done every
day; and take great care to observe every order given you,
and to be always in company, as the weather shall allow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>3. And should it happen that any ship or small vessel,
through stress of weather or other cause that may be, parts
company, they must look for us first of all in the island of
Bayona, on the coast of Galicia, and the fleet will wait till it
is time to proceed and you shall have found us; and thence,
if you should not find us, you shall go to Puerto Sancto, and
there you shall wait for us three days; and should we not be
there, you shall make for the island of Guadaloupe (a small
island near Dominica towards the north-east), where we will
stay three days, and will leave some signal that you may
know what course we shall have taken, which shall be for
Puerto Rico; there we will stay ten days.</p>

<p>4. If in the course of this voyage you meet with any foul
wind or bad weather, you must take in all sail at night till
morning, unless you see that one of your admirals carries
sail, in which case you shall do the same.</p>

<p>5. And if foul wind or bad weather should come on at
night, your admiral will hang out two lanterns, one above
the other, and the height of a man asunder, that you may
steer by them.</p>

<p>6. And if we should all shorten sail over night on account
of the weather, and it be necessary to make sail the same
night, you must show, before we make sail, a single lantern
with a light at the bow, and another at the fore-top.</p>

<p>7. You shall keep no light in any of the ships, but only
the light in the binocle, and this with the greatest care that
it be not seen, excepting the admiral’s ship; and to avoid the
danger of fire, you must not bear about any candle or light
in the ship, unless in a lantern; and neither more nor less,
you must take the greatest care with the fire in the galley.</p>

<p>8. No vessel, square or cutter-rigged, should go ahead
of the admiral at night, particularly in rough weather; or
get under the lee of large vessels, in tacking from side to
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>9. And if any vessel of the fleet should lose, through mischance,
a main-mast, or yard, or any of the water vessels, or
anything else of importance, they shall fire one or two shots,
according to the necessity of the case, that the other vessels
may afford them speedy assistance; and take care that no
vessel quit that which is in distress till the required succour
be given.</p>

<p>10. Should any vessel of the fleet lose her course, and fall
in with another of the fleet, the signal shall be to hoist and
lower topsails three times; and the other vessel shall do the
same for recognition.</p>

<p>11. You must not permit any gambling in the ship, with
cards or dice, by reason of the numerous quarrels usually
resulting from that practice.</p>

<p>12. You must take the greatest care to save the provisions,
following your own discretion in this matter till you receive
another order for your guidance.</p>

<p>13. Finally, in order that you may be better able to keep
company, you shall see a light at the admiral’s stern once or
twice.</p>
